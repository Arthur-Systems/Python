# Assignment: Assignment 1: Hangman
# Author: Arthur Wei
# Finish Time: 2022-10-05
# Description: hangman.py is a program that plays a hangman game.
# Input: file 'dictionary_short.txt' The user will be prompted to enter the size of the word and the number of lives. The user will also be prompted to enter a letter.
# Output: The program will print the hangman game. It will also print the word with the correct letters filled in. It will also print the letters that have been guessed.

# make a dictionary.txt in the same folder where hangman.py is located
